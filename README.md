# SearchPlus
It is a chrome extension project in progress. I intend to privide easy and powerful page search functionality and more.

## Current Features
0. By default, Ctrl+Shift+Enter for popup window.
1. Simple javascript interpreter, capable of manipulating elements of current page. ("/code"+Enter to enter)
   In code mode, shift+enter to execute js code; shift + up/down to scroll over execution history
2. History log (up arrow key to view previous "entered" results, "/clear" to clear history).
3. Highlight functions: match("/normal"+Enter to enter), Multi-highlight("/multi"+Enter to enter)
4. In normal or multi mode, press Enter to scroll over all elements. (Currently there maybe some hidden elements not detected as hidden)
